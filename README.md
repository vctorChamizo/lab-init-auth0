# Lab | Auth0
First steps with Auth0 to create a simple service to management accounts.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000/api](http://localhost:3000/).

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles GraphQl, Apollo Server &. Typescript in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
